# USAi Practice Lab Introduction Meeting

Planning note for introducing Practice Lab to the USAi team.

## Meeting Details

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Team** | USAi |
| **Date** | 2026-01-30 |
| **Duration** | 60 minutes |
| **Goal** | Get team buy-in for Practice Lab AND seed initial content for team practices repo |
| **Mural** | [USAi Practice Lab Introduction](https://app.mural.co/t/flexion5965/m/flexion5965/1738252687816/4a6cf0f0cc95a93dd4a78cd6d8a64e93e77bb09e) |

## Slide Deck

[Marp slide deck](presentations/2026-01-30-usai-practice-lab-intro.md) — see [presentations README](presentations/README.md) for build instructions.

## Mural Setup

The Mural board should have:

1. **Header section** at top:
   - Title: "Practice Lab Introduction — USAi"
   - Date: January 30, 2026
   - Brief description: "We're exploring how to develop shared practices as a team. Your input today seeds our team practices repository."

2. **Three columns** for Rose/Thorn/Bud:
   - 🌹 **Roses**: "Practices that work well — What helps you deliver effectively? What would you teach a new team member?"
   - 🌵 **Thorns**: "Friction — Where do you feel friction? What causes rework or confusion?"
   - 🌱 **Buds**: "Wishes — What practices have you seen elsewhere that we should try? What would make your work easier?"

3. **Clustering zone** below columns:
   - Space to drag and group related items
   - Label: "Themes"

4. **Voting zone**:
   - Label: "Top Themes (dot vote — 3 votes each)"
   - Space for prioritized clusters

5. **Next Steps section** at bottom:
   - First Practice Lab date: ___
   - Repo location: ___
   - Initial focus area: ___

## Facilitation Flow

| Phase | Duration | Instructions |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Presentation** | 10 min | Walk through slides, demo a documented practice |
| **Silent brainstorm** | 5 min | Everyone adds items to all three columns. No talking. |
| **Pair share** | 5 min | Find a partner, discuss your items, add new ones sparked by conversation |
| **Clustering** | 10 min | As a group, drag related items together, name the clusters |
| **Dot vote** | 5 min | Everyone gets 3 dots, vote on most important themes |
| **Discussion** | 5 min | Discuss top-voted themes, what they tell us |
| **Commit** | 5 min | Agree on first Practice Lab date, next steps |

## Key Talking Points

### Why Now?
- AI-assisted development accelerates everything—including drift
- Without explicit practices, each person develops their own approach
- Clients benefit when teams operate cohesively

### Why a Repo?
- Searchable, versioned, always available
- Practices evolve—git tracks that evolution
- New team members can onboard from it
- Shows engineering maturity

### Give Credit
During the "What We'd Capture" slide, call out Marco's exploration of AI-assisted workflows. This validates ongoing efforts and shows Practice Lab builds on existing momentum.

## After the Meeting

1. **Create team practices repo** (new repo, separate from personal knowledge bases)
2. **Transfer themes** from Mural to repo as initial content (even rough notes)
3. **Schedule first Practice Lab** (30 min, weekly)
4. **Share repo link** with team

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Slides created and reviewed
- [ ] Mural board created and customized
- [ ] Calendar invite sent with Mural link
