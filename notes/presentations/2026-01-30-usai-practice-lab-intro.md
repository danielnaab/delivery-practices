# USAi Practice Lab
## Developing Shared Practices as a Team

Flexion USAi Team
January 30, 2026

<!--
Thanks for joining in. I've been thinking about our team practices a bit, and how we can improve them, so the idea of this meeting is to share some thoughts and then open up a discussion with the team. I'm going to do a quick slide deck and share some ideas, and then move to a Mural board to do a retro-style liberating structure.

# The Challenge

**Great teams don't just happen—they develop shared practices.**

- Knowledge stays in individual heads
- Each person develops their own approach
- New team members reinvent solutions
- Context gets lost between projects and sessions

**AI-assisted development amplifies both the opportunity and the risk:**
We can move faster than ever, but without shared practices, we drift faster too.

<!--
We as a team have a lot going for us - we have a lot of expertise and we're doing great work, but I think we have room to improve on how we function as a team. I can say that I know I haven't personally put much effort into being constructive on how we, specifically us here at Flexion, can be impactful on the USAi team. But there are definitely practices good teams have that we can work on - sharing best-practices, trying new ideas as a team, etc. AI amplifies our opportunities, but also the risk potential. Moving fast is great, but if we're not aligned, we're going to quickly build a pretty big mess.

# The Opportunity

**Teams with documented, evolving practices:**

- Onboard new members faster
- Maintain consistency across the codebase
- Learn from what works (and what doesn't)
- Demonstrate engineering leadership to clients

**Shared practices = force multiplier for the whole team**

<!--
So it goes without saying that teams that are well-aligned with best-practices get good results. Easy to understand code, easy team member onboarding, enhanced reputation with the client. So it seems worth investing in.

# The Proposal: Practice Lab

**Weekly 30-minute meeting focused on practice improvement**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 10 min | **Observations** — What worked? What friction? |
| 10 min | **Pattern Recognition** — Recurring themes? |
| 5 min | **Experiment** — ONE thing to try next week |
| 5 min | **Capture** — Write it down |

*The meeting feeds a team knowledge base; the KB is the artifact, not the meeting.*

<!--
So I'd like to propose that we start doing some weekly meetings to hone our process and identify opportunities and areas for improvement. Here's an example format: we can discuss what we've been experiencing lately - what's working, what's not. And hopefully that will feed into some clear patterns that we can dig into, and identify some experiments we can start working on. We don't want to go too crazy on this - starting small and building success incrementally would be the idea, so one experiment or new thing to try per week seems like a decent target. But the big thing is we need to start writing down what we're doing, formalizing it into team documentation, and generally just having a source of truth for how we do things, and making sure that source of truth is collaboratively developed and iterated on when we learn new things. So I envision team documentation as being the main output from this, and we take the documentation and put its practices to use in our day-to-day work.

# How It Works

**Observations → Patterns → Experiments → Documented Practices**
                                                    ↓
                            *...which inform new observations*

Example: [github.com/flexion/usai-delivery-practices](https://github.com/flexion/usai-delivery-practices)

**Discovery-focused, not validation-focused**

- Low ceremony: 30 min/week, simple format
- Git repo as shared memory: searchable, versioned, always available
- Practices evolve based on real experience

<!--
So it might work something like this... observe, identify opportunities, agree on a practice or follow-up for the week, and document what we're doing as we go. This should all be feeding back into our work, so it's more of a cycle than a linear process. But we should version-control this stuff, collaboratively edit it, do documentation reviews, and generally be rigorous.
-->

# What We'd Capture

**Examples of team practices:**

- Code review approaches
- Testing strategies
- AI-assisted workflow patterns
- Definition of done agreements
- Ensemble collaborative coding

*Marco is our collaborative coding expert and can help us seed some initial practices.*

<!--
Our repo can cover anything relevant. Some examples are code review approaches, testing strategies, AI coding workflows, documentation patterns, etc. I think a big opportunity for us, as long as we have Marco on the team for the next few weeks, is to dip our toes into collaborative coding, so that might be a really good starting point for us.

# A Concrete Example

**Demo: Two documented practices**

- [Living Specifications](https://github.com/danielnaab/delivery-practices/blob/main/docs/living-specifications/README.md)
- [Documentation / KB Guidelines](https://github.com/danielnaab/meta-knowledge-base)

What makes these useful:
- Clear structure with intent, how-to, sources
- Grounded in real experience, not theory
- Evolves as we learn

<!--
But to give some concrete examples of what this might look like, I'll show a couple of my personal repos.

# Today's Activity

**Let's seed our team practices with your input**

🌹 **Roses**: Practices that work well
🌵 **Thorns**: Friction in how we deliver
🌱 **Buds**: Practices you wish we had

*Your ideas become the starting content for our shared practices repo.*

<!--
So, we've got a Mural board to go through. It's in this format of roses/thorns/buds - kind of a semi-retro-like format.
-->

---

# What Happens Next

1. **Today**: Your input seeds the team practices repo
2. **This week**: We create the repo, transfer themes
3. **Next week**: First Practice Lab (30 min)
4. **Ongoing**: Practices evolve based on what we learn

*The repo becomes our shared memory.*

<!--
What I'd like to do is collect everyone's thoughts today and then figure out what next steps should be. I can collect input and seed it into our repo. Then, next week, we can figure out what our first steps are. Collaborative coding would be my thought, but we should talk about our options.

# Let's Go!

**Board is ready**

1. Silent brainstorm (5 min)
2. Pair share (5 min)
3. Cluster themes (10 min)
4. Dot vote (5 min)
5. Discuss top themes (5 min)
