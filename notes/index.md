# Notes

Working notes and explorations for delivery practices.

Notes are **ephemeral** - graduate to [docs/](../docs/) when stable.

## Active Explorations

(None currently active)

## Graduated

- [Living Specifications](./2026-01-23-living-specifications.md) → Graduated to [docs/](../docs/), [policies/](../policies/living-specifications.md), [playbooks/](../playbooks/)

## Sessions

### 2026-01-24
- [Tooling Cleanup](./2026-01-24-tooling-cleanup.md) - Spec-implementation alignment, exit codes, hygiene

### 2026-01-23
- [Initialization](./2026-01-23-initialization.md) - KB setup
- [Living Specifications](./2026-01-23-living-specifications.md) - Exploring specs as living documentation (graduated)

## Guidelines

- **Time-bound** - Capture point-in-time thinking
- **Date-prefixed** - YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Ephemeral** - Archive or extract when complete
- **Exploratory** - Less rigor than docs/
- **Graduated notes remain** - Kept as historical reference; they preserve the exploratory context and reasoning that led to stable content

## Graduation Path

When insights stabilize:
1. Extract to docs/
2. Add provenance linking to note
3. Mark note "Graduated to [location]"
4. Archive or leave for reference
