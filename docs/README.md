# Delivery Practices

Knowledge base for **software delivery practices that enable fast and safe AI-assisted development**.

**Status**: Working - First practice area established

## Practice Areas

- **[Specifications](specifications/)** - Living specifications as source of truth

## Knowledge Types

This repository organizes content by knowledge type:

| Directory | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| [docs/](.) | Declarative | Concepts, models, reference ("understand this") |
| [policies/](../policies/) | Normative | Principles, rules, constraints ("follow this") |
| [playbooks/](../playbooks/) | Procedural | Step-by-step guides ("do this") |
| [notes/](../notes/) | Ephemeral | Explorations, working notes ("thinking about this") |

## Philosophy

- **Evidence-driven** - Document practices based on real experience, not theory
- **Minimal structure** - Create organization only when content emerges
- **Source-grounded** - All practice recommendations cite sources
- **Evolving** - Iterate based on what works

## How Content Will Emerge

As practices are discovered:
1. **Capture in notes/** - Quick documentation with date prefix
2. **Let patterns emerge** - Notice when multiple practices relate
3. **Create structure** - When you have related practices, organize them
4. **Graduate stable content** - Move from notes/ to docs/

**Meta**: Follows [meta knowledge base conventions](../../.graft/meta-knowledge-base/docs/meta.md)
