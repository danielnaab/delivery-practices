# Delivery Practices

Knowledge base for **software delivery practices that enable fast and safe AI-assisted development**.

**Status**: Working - First practice area established

## Practice Areas

- **[Specifications](specifications/)** - Living specifications as source of truth: format, workflow, collaboration, verification

## Philosophy

- **Evidence-driven** - Document practices based on real experience, not theory
- **Minimal structure** - Create organization only when content emerges
- **Source-grounded** - All practice recommendations cite sources
- **Evolving** - Iterate based on what works

## How Content Will Emerge

As practices are discovered:
1. **Capture in notes/** - Quick documentation with date prefix (e.g., `notes/2026-01-25-practice-name.md`)
2. **Let patterns emerge** - Notice when multiple practices relate to same area
3. **Create structure** - When you have 3+ related practices, create a directory (e.g., `docs/development/`)
4. **Graduate stable content** - Move proven practices from notes/ to docs/

## Current Work

- See [notes/](../notes/) for active explorations
- See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for agent instructions

## Getting Started

**For documenting a new practice**:
1. Create a note: `notes/YYYY-MM-DD-practice-name.md`
2. Document what you tried, what worked, what didn't
3. Include sources (experience, references, context)
4. Mark status as draft/working

**When ready to stabilize**:
1. Create appropriate directory in docs/ (if it doesn't exist)
2. Move or extract content from notes/
3. Mark as working or stable
4. Update this README with links
