# Delivery Practices Knowledge Base

Knowledge base for exploring **software delivery practices that enable fast and safe AI-assisted development**.

## Entrypoints

- **Humans**: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
- **Agents**: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)

## Purpose

Personal exploration of delivery practices for:
- Fast, safe development with AI assistance
- SDLC practices that work in professional contexts (including Flexion)
- Evidence-based evolution of effective methods

## Scope

Any SDLC aspect relevant to speed, safety, and effectiveness. Content areas will emerge based on real project needs.

## Knowledge Base System

Follows [meta-knowledge-base](../meta-knowledge-base/docs/meta.md) conventions:
- Evidence-driven evolution
- Lifecycle states: draft → working → stable → deprecated
- Provenance for all practice recommendations
- Temporal layers: ephemeral (notes/) vs. durable (docs/)

## Structure

- `docs/` - Curated, stable practices (will grow organically)
- `notes/` - Exploration and active iteration

## Getting Started

Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for current practices and [notes/](notes/) for active explorations.

**Status**: Draft (v0.1.0) - Minimal initialization, content will grow based on evidence
